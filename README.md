# ArtPlug

ArtPlug is a powerful Obsidian plugin designed to enhance your note-taking and writing experience. Inspired by Jordan Peterson's Self-Authoring Guide and drawing concepts from Essay.app, ArtPlug provides a suite of tools to help you organize, create, rewrite, and reorder your content efficiently.

## Features

1. **Outline View**: Quickly navigate through your document's structure.
2. **Create View**: Easily create new content within your notes, inspired by guided writing exercises.
3. **Rewrite View**: Effortlessly rewrite and refine your sentences, similar to Essay.app's revision tools.
4. **Reorder View**: Reorganize your content with a simple drag-and-drop interface.

## Inspiration

ArtPlug draws inspiration from:

- **Jordan Peterson's Self-Authoring Guide**: The Create View incorporates concepts from this guide, encouraging structured and reflective writing.
- **Essay.app**: The Rewrite View is influenced by Essay.app's approach to sentence refinement and content improvement.
